1. Docker Toolbox ()[https://www.docker.com/products/docker-toolbox] which includes the following items

   * Docker Runtime v1.11 and above
   * Docker-compose

### Post Install - viewing services deployed to qubeship
In order to view the services deployed via qubeship, you will have to take some special steps. This is necessary because the local kubernetes installation doesn't give access to services over standard endpoints. As a one time setup effort, you have to run this from the bootsrap directory.
```
  qubeship_home/bin/kube-service-patch.sh
```
Step 1: determine your service name:
    this is the container prefix of your project.
    `kubectl get services`
```
NAME                             CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
kubernetes                       10.0.0.1     <none>        443/TCP          3d
qubefirstpythonproject-service   10.0.0.63    <none>        443/TCP,80/TCP   2h
```

Step 2:
use the access_qubeservice utilty to figure out your service url  
```
qubeship_home/bin/access_qubeservice.sh qubefirstpythonproject-service /api
qubefirstjavaproject-service
IP address of the qubefirstjavaproject-service-service : 10.0.0.63 for api
curl http://10.0.0.63/api
{"api": "hello world"}
```   



### FAQ:
   1. How do I stop Qubeship services?
   
      In the bootstrap folder, do a: `./down.sh`
      
   1. If the Qubeship services stop, how can I start them again?
      
      In the bootstrap folder, do a: `./run.sh`. Note: After the script has finished, it will take the Qubeship services a few minutes to further process before they become available.
      
      When Qubeship is ready, you'll be able to use the Swagger API at [http://192.168.99.100:9080](http://192.168.99.100:9080) and be able to access Qubeship itself at [http://192.168.99.100:7000](http://192.168.99.100:7000). Note: If this Qubeship URL does not show you any content, try logging out and in again.
      

   1. I rebooted my machine and Qubeship stopped working, what should I do?
      
      The best way to avoid this problem is to "Save State" in VirtualBox before rebooting and then "start" the VM again.

      If you didn't do this, here are some more options:
      
      * Open VirtualBox and make sure the "default" VM is running. If not, "start" it.
      * Make sure the VM has finished booting and is showing you a terminal UI.
      * In the bootstrap folder, do a: `./run.sh` to restart Qubeship's services.
   
   1. I tried installing Qubeship, but the script is giving me an error: exec: “Docker-credential-osxkeychain”: executable file not found in $PATH out: ``. What’s wrong?

    It sounds like your docker config file is slightly misconfigured. 
    This can happen if you’ve converted from Docker for Mac to Docker Toolbox,
    or similar nonstandard situations. Your system thinks that your credentials are being stored on an 
    external credentials store such as native keychain of operating system (which is good, 
    as it’s typically much more secure than storing it in docker configuration file),
    but it lacks the actual docker-credential-osxkeychain executable to make the connection. 
    You can confirm this by looking in your ~/.docker/config.json file for
    “credsStore”: “osxkeychain”

    If you see it, then you’ve got confirmation. To fix this, you have two options:

    a. Install the docker-credential-osxkeychain: 
    You need to go to https://github.com/docker/docker-credential-helpers/releases,
    find the Release version marked ‘Latest release’ (probably the top block), and then click 
    docker-credential-osxkeychain-v#.#.#-#####.tar.gz’ where ‘#.#.#’ is the release number.
    Unzip the downloaded file, and then put the resulting ‘docker-credential-osxkeychain’
    executable file into your /usr/local/bin directory (user's local bin). Now uninstall and 
    then reinstall Qubeship.

    --- or ---

    b. Tell your system you want to store your credentials locally:
    Simply remove the “credsStore”: “osxkeychain” from ~/.docker/config.json and then uninstall 
    and reinstall Qubeship. Easy, but less secure.

    Again, we highly recommend that you try for option ‘a’ as it’s definitely the most secure way to go.
