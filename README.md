### Post Install - viewing services deployed to qubeship
In order to view the services deployed via qubeship, you will have to take some special steps. This is necessary because the local kubernetes installation doesn't give access to services over standard endpoints. As a one time setup effort, you have to run this from the bootsrap directory.
```
  qubeship_home/bin/kube-service-patch.sh
```
Step 1: determine your service name:
    this is the container prefix of your project.
    `kubectl get services`
```
NAME                             CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
kubernetes                       10.0.0.1     <none>        443/TCP          3d
qubefirstpythonproject-service   10.0.0.63    <none>        443/TCP,80/TCP   2h
```

Step 2:
use the access_qubeservice utilty to figure out your service url  
```
qubeship_home/bin/access_qubeservice.sh qubefirstpythonproject-service /api
qubefirstjavaproject-service
IP address of the qubefirstjavaproject-service-service : 10.0.0.63 for api
curl http://10.0.0.63/api
{"api": "hello world"}
```
